# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO 
Type fast to survive

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO 
Basically you have to type fast in order to survive, or you will be dead.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO
I'm making a fast-paced typing game called Type to Survive for my final project, in which players must type fast to stay alive. The player's typing speed is tested in the game; if they type too slowly, they will "die," and the game will finish. Keeping your fingers moving quickly and accurately is key to winning this game. You'll be out if you don't type quickly enough, but the faster you type, the longer you stay alive!


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO 
My outcome would be a functional game 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO 
My outcome would be a functional game that people find enjoyable.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO 
My outcome would be a functional game, people finding it enjoyable and if this game might people to type more faster and accurately that would be my accomplishment.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
My next step is to improve the typing operations of the game such that it recognizes player speed and terminates if the user types too slowly. In order to make everything seem and feel smooth, I'll mostly use Tkinter or pygame to create a simple yet engaging ui. Choosing the difficulty levels and scoring system will assist keep the game enjoyable and difficult. Lastly, to ensure it works perfectly, I'll test and troubleshooting.
